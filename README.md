# JavaScript Number Guessing Game Project

This is a Modal Window developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript during "The Complete JavaScript Course" by Jonas Schmedtmann.
The window has three buttons which open modals with a transparent overlay and a white text page!

I learned a lot about class manipulation, click and keypress events with this project!

## JavaScript Used

- Math.random()
- DOM manipulations
- functions
- conditionals
- loops
- keypress events
